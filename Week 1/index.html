                <h2>About me</h2>
                <p>I am a 4th year statistics major and neuroscience minor. None of my previous classes have taught me web programming or how 
                    to work with geospatial data, so I hope to gain these skills by taking this course. Given my interests in data science and 
                    analytics, these skills will be useful to learn before I graduate. Another reason I'm interested in digital map making is 
                    because I enjoy traveling and getting to know new cities. I grew up in the New York City area, and I've been to most 
                    major east coast cities, Canada, and a few countries in Europe. I've enjoyed exploring LA during college, and I hope to 
                    see more of the west coast and other continents in the future.
